# QBronze-Project-Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to the project notebooks given in QBronze. You can download them and put/replace them in the checkpoint folder (or directly open them) to see the solutions.

Note: The images, contents of "qworld" and some of the sub routines were directly taken from QBronze.
